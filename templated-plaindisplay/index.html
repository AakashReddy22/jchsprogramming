			<h2>What do we do?</h2>
			<span class="byline">Because of online learning, the way that we operate has changed significantly.</span> </div>
		<div id="three-column">
			<div class="boxA">
				<div class="box"> <span class="fa fa-copy"></span>
					<p>Programming can often be a difficult and unforgiving subject. Often times, the solution to problems can take hours and sometimes days to debug and resolve. If left unbridled, this coerces many to copy code, which is malpractice and inhibits your programming potential. We strive to prevent copied code and we develop your skills and proficiency at abseloutely no cost. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="boxB">
				<div class="box"> <span class="fa fa-list-ul"></span>
					<p>If you are not already familiar, "signoffs" are coding assignments graded at minor and major assessments. Here, we see many students copy code frequently and as a result, do very poorly on hand coding across all languages. By helping students step by step with signoffs, we equip them with the knowledge to: understand the signoff, recreate the elements discussed in the signoff, and give the oppourtunity for the student to employ their acquired skills. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="boxC">
				<div class="box"> <span class="fa fa-user"></span>
					<p>At the end of the day, our goal is to help people seeking programming assistance, the proper way. After you complete your computer science class, or feel like you want to partake in more challenging projects, please feel free to hop into some Networking Club meetings, and understand how you can use your skills in real world applications. </p>

				<h2>Computer Science and Self Directedness</h2>
				<span class="byline">Changing a common aspect is impossible, but altering the way you approach it isn't</span> </div>
			<p>In computer science, self directed learning is the best way to master a project, and we at Programming Club are in no means trying to deveiate students from that. However, students rarely practice self directed learning until they reach High School, and for younger students, this can be very discouraging and in some cases compells students to abandon Computer Science entirerly. Here at Programming Club, we help younger students cope with the harshness of learning independetly and give them valuable skills and knowledge to be competitive in the real world. </p>

			<h2>How Universal Remote Learning Changes our club</h2>
			<span class="byline"> Virtual Learning 2020-21</span> </div>
		<p> Although, we may not be able to hold in-person meetings, students can still hone in on their programming skills virtually. Our select group of admins have been in the computer science department for years and are experienced in programming, whether it be on any medium. Our club is open to all students from all high schools and will be hosted on discord as of August 19th 2020.</p>
